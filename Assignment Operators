#Given that we have two products, a laptop and a mouse such that the price of a laptop is 300000 and the one of a mouse is 50000
# , use a forloop to find the total sum of the product
laptop= 300000
mouse= 50000

product_prices =[laptop,mouse,70000]
for price in product_prices:
    sum+=price

total_cost = laptop
